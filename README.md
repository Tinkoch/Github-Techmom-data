By the end of the module, students will apply their SQL skills to query the student application data from Module 2, conducting an in-depth analysis and writing a long-form report to summarize their findings, demonstrating their ability to draw insights from real-world data using SQL.

## Learning Outcomes: 

1. Understand SQL Basics
2. Retrieve Data Using SQL
3. Filter and Sort Data
4. Aggregate and Summarize Data
5. Conduct Data Analysis
6. Share Queries

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data within a database, making it essential for tasks like data analysis, reporting, and backend development. SQL is widely used in various fields to efficiently handle large datasets, perform queries, and retrieve meaningful insights from data. It's a powerful tool for anyone working with data, from beginners to advanced users.

_Est. Time to Complete: 5 mins_

In SQL, the `SELECT` and `FROM` statements are fundamental for retrieving data from a database. The `SELECT` statement specifies the columns you want to retrieve, while the `FROM` statement indicates the table where the data is stored. For example, `SELECT name, age FROM users;` retrieves the "name" and "age" columns from the "users" table. These commands allow users to filter and view specific data, making them essential for data querying and analysis in SQL.

_Est. Time to Complete: 8 mins_

The `WHERE` clause in SQL is used to filter records in a query based on specified conditions. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet certain criteria, making your data more precise and relevant. For example, `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';` retrieves only the rows where the department is "Sales." The `WHERE` clause can use operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`, and `IN` to define the conditions, making it a powerful tool for refining queries and focusing on specific data subsets.

_Est. Time to Complete: 8 mins_

In SQL, the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses are used to organize and sort data in queries. The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, or `AVG` to perform calculations on grouped data. For example, `GROUP BY department` will group data by each department.

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the query results based on specified columns, either in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. For example, `ORDER BY salary DESC` will sort the results by salary from highest to lowest. These clauses help in organizing data for clearer insights and analysis.
